Welcome to VI Java API Beta Release. 

WHAT IS VI JAVA API?
VI Java API is a set of Java libraries that aim to ease the usage of VI 
SDK Web Services interfaces. It's now open sourced under BSD license.

It provides the following benefits to the Java developers:

* Enables OO programming with a well defined managed object model
* Reduces the need to use ManagedObjectReference and makes possible 
  compile time type checking
* Hides the complexity of the PropertyCollector
* Provides necessary utility classes to simplify VI SDK web interfaces
* Leverages current VI SDK web services interface while keeping it intact

As a result, the application code using this API is much shorter (70% less) 
and much more readable than the equivalent using web service interfaces 
directly. The API itself is straight-forward and easy to learn and use. 

WHAT IS INCLUDED?
Everything is packaged into one Jar file, including the Java source code, 
binary, sample code, license. 

HOW TO GET STARTED?
To get started, please include the jar downloaded in your existing VI 
SDK project.
